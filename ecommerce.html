    <h2>Project Overview</h2><br>
    <div id="projectoverview">
      <h3>Challenge:</h3>
      <p>
        There is a fine line between suggesting the user do something while
        maintaining a good experience and manipulating the user by restricting  their choices. It was important to design this site to meet the client's expectations while also keeping
        the user in mind.

    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>What is the Goal?</h3>
    <p>
      To design a user-friendly, accessible platform for the client to sell their products. The art used on the products was very personal to the client so it was very
      important that they be able to showcase it to the user. Creating an eCommerce site is tricky. There are so many out there

  <h3>Social Media</h3>
  <p>
    The only content the client had at the time were the physical products so I contacted local models and set up a photo shoot for their products. This is when my role expanded
    from a UX designer to more of a projects manager role while also fulfilling the needs of UX Design. After creating content for the site I edited the photos using Adobe Photoshop
    and optimize them for social media and the site. When the content was ready to be delivered I met with the artist and we discussed possible captions for the pictures. This was important
    because they would be the user's first impression of the brand. This would be the way they created a bond with the user.

  <h3>Managing the Project</h3>
  <p>
    As this project developed it became clear that my role was not only a UX designer but also a project manager. I was the only other person on the team besides the artist
    so everything besides creating the designs was my responsibility. This was a great chance to expand my skills as a leader and put together a project from scratch. The biggest
    challenge I faced was gathering/creating the resources that would be needed for this project to be a success. This was something I had never done before and I was excited
    to dive in head first. Through reading documentation and experimenting I was able to work with the tools that were provided and in the end deliver a site that the client was happy
    with.

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Managing a project requires a great amount of attention. To be successful you must be able to prioritize while keeping in mind deadlines. Being able to focus on multiple things and keep them on
    track is a huge factor in a projects outcome.
  </li>
  <br>
  <img id="learnedicon" src="prioritize.png" alt="icon representing a checklist and timer" width="200" height="100" class="img-fluid">
  <li>
    Delegating tasks is just as important as being able to prioritize. When a project requires multiple tasks to be done at the same time there might not be enough time or resources for one person
    to complete it themselves. This is why delegating is important. It can save a project and while creating this site it was essential that I delegate tasks so the deadline was met.
  </li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img id="learnedicon" src="team.png" alt="icon representing a team" width="200" height="100" class="img-fluid">
  <li>
      Being able to prioritize and delegate is important but to be an effective leader you must know how to communicate with people. This is more than listening and responding to them, it's a more
      active skill that requires you to understand a person and empathize with their needs. When you are able to understand their needs you are able to be a better leader.
  </li>
