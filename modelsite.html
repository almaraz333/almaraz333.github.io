    <h2>Project Overview</h2><br>
    <div id="projectoverview">
      <h3>Challenge:</h3>
      <p>
        Design a way to best display a large amount of photos in a way that doesn't overwhelm the user. The photos need to easily accessible to featured
        on the front page prominently. This site would be the main way the client would get work so it was extremely  important that the design let the client

    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>What is the Goal?</h3>
    <p>
      To create and easy to use platform for the client to upload their content for agencies and potential employers to see. It was extremely important
      that this site be easily accessible by the client. My main concern was that the client be able to upload new pictures and edit their appearance
      on the site any time they want with no trouble. Managing content should not be a hindrance to the creation of content, it should facilitate it.
      Modeling was their passion and I felt an obligation to create something amazing for them to reflect their
      love of modeling.

<div id="book">
  <h3>Booking</h3>
  <p>
    Bookings are the main way models generate income. It was essential that the user be able to find a way to contact client if they need to.
    To do this I made a simple page in which the user could send a message directly to the client's email with a pre-determined subject. This was
    an important part of the UX so the client can sort through their email and find only the ones relating to bookings. Being able to access data when
    you want it but having it out of the way when you don't is a cornerstone of a good user experience.

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<img id="learnedicon" src="communication.png" alt="icon representing what was learned" width="200" height="100" class="img-fluid">
<li>
Clear communication with the client is key to bringing their idea to life and creating the perfect product for them. Being a UX designer is more than just
designing, it is connecting with other people.
</li>
<br>
<img id="learnedicon" src="why.png" alt="#a11y" width="200" height="100" class="img-fluid">
<li>
To design something means to know the user. Effectively creating a space means the designer must understand the user. This is not just
asking simple "yes" or "no" questions. It is understanding WHAT the user is doing, WHY they are doing it, and HOW they are accomplishing that.
</li>
<br>
<img id="learnedicon" src="connection.png" alt="icon representing what was learned" width="200" height="100" class="img-fluid">
<li>
Creating something so close to a person's passion is a huge responsibility. This means the designer must connect with the user and the client to understand them.
This goes beyond asking WHAT, WHY, and HOW. The designer must empathize with the user and create a connection with them.

The final deliverable was a professional portfolio site for the client to display their content for potential future employment as a model.
