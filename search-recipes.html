          <h3>What is the Goal?</h3>
          <p>
            The goal for this project was to make a web app that is able to search recipes by ingredients or dish. The idea for this was born when I decided I wanted to start cooking
            different things to eat but was tired of trying to decide what to make. This app would make it easy to find recipes based on what I wanted to eat ot what I had in the fridge.

          <h3>Dynamically Created Content with JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            When the idea for this project first came up I thought it would be interesting to see how a site almost entirely created by JavaScript would turn out. 
            I knew this wasn't the most efficient way to create a site but I was still curious. I figured this would be a good experiment and a way to practice some JavaScript
            skills. What I noticed was that creating a site through JavaScript can become tedious. For this it was important to create functions to handle a bulk of the 
            work and reduce the amount of code. In the end the web app turned out great and it really helped me solidify my understanding of JavaScript and how it 
            interacts with the DOM.

                class="img-fluid darkmode">
              <li>
                Color can play a huge role in how the user experiences a product. This is why the color scheme of the app focuses on yellow and red. These colors make people think
                of food and hunger (McDonald's, Wendy's, In-n-Out).

              <li>
                Creating a site completely from JavaScript I was able to really cement my skills in using JavaScript to interact with the DOM. This is 
                incredibly useful and can be used to crate web pages that interact with the user in a new way.

              <li>
                Designing for mobile in mind is important. More and more people are accessing sites mobiles and as this trend continues the mobile versions of sites
                become the focus of development. I experienced this first hand when I wanted to use my web app from my phone while I was cooking. Having a dedicated, user-friendly 
                version made searching recipes so much easier.
